        <p>The following code creates an id that can be used for a paragraph, a heading, or other
            elements that you’ll learn about later. But remember, any id, including this one, should be
            used only once on any HTML page. For example, if you use it for a paragraph, don’t use it
            for another paragraph, a heading, or any other element on the page.</p>
