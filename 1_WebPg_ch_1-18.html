        <p id=mission-statement>The following code creates an id that can be used for a paragraph, a heading, or other elements that you’ll learn about later. But remember, any id, including this one, should be used only once on any HTML page. For example, if you use it for a paragraph, don’t use it for another paragraph, a heading, or any other element on the page.</p>
        <div id="midpage">
            <h2>This is a heading inside the div.</h2>
            <p>This is a paragraph inside the div. The heading inherits the font-family of the div because no font-family has been assigned to h2 headings in the CSS file. Paragraphs, on the other hand, have been styled with Georgia and its relatives. The specific styling for paragraphs overrides the styling of the div. If you want paragraphs inside the div to display in Arial and its relatives like the heading, you'd have to style these paragraphs specifically, with a class of their own.</p>
